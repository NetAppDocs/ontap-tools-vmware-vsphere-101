REST APIs can be used to perform several ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere management operations. REST APIs are exposed through the Swagger web page.

You can access the Swagger web page available at _\https://loadbalancerIP:8443/_ to display the REST API documentation, as well as to manually issue an API call.
[NOTE]
All the APIs have request body and examples mentioned in the swagger page. The workflows and examples provided in this section are for reference purposes only.
