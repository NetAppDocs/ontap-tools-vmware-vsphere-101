= Configure ONTAP user roles and privileges
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
You can configure new user roles and privileges for managing storage backends using the JSON file provided with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere and ONTAP System Manager.

*What you'll need*

* You should have downloaded the ONTAP privileges file from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere using _\https://<loadbalancerIP>:8443/virtualization/user-privileges/users_roles.zip_.
* You should have downloaded the ONTAP Privileges file from ONTAP tools using `\https://<loadbalancerIP>:8443/virtualization/user-privileges/users_roles.zip`.
+
[NOTE]
You can create users at cluster or directly at storage virtual machines (SVMs) level. You can also create users without using the user_roles.json file and if done so, you need to have a minimum set of privileges at SVM level.

* You should have logged in with administrator privileges for the storage backend.

*Steps*

. Extract the downloaded _\https://<loadbalancerIP>:8443/virtualization/user-privileges/users_roles.zip_ file.
. Access ONTAP System Manager using the cluster management IP address of the cluster.
. Log in as the cluster or SVM user.
. Select *Cluster* > *Settings* > *Users and Roles* pane.
. Select *Add* under Users.
. In the *Add User* dialog box, select *Virtualization products*.
. *Browse* to select and upload the ONTAP Privileges JSON file.
+
The Product field is auto populated.

. Select the required capability from the product capability drop-down menu.
+
The *Role* field is auto populated based on the product capability selected.

. Enter the required username and password.
. Select the privileges (Discovery, Create Storage, Modify Storage, Destroy Storage, NAS/SAN Role) required for the user, and then click *Add*.

The new role and user are added, and you can see the detailed privileges under the role that you have configured.
// edited for 10.0 release

NOTE: The uninstall operation does not remove ONTAP tool roles but removes the localized names for the ONTAP tool specific privileges and appends the prefix `XXX missing privilege` to them. When you reinstall ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere or upgrade to a newer version, all the standard ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere roles and ONTAP tools-specific privileges are restored.

== SVM aggregate mapping requirements

To use SVM user credentials for provisioning datastores, internally ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere creates volumes on the aggregate specified in the datastores POST API. The ONTAP does not allow the creation of volumes on unmapped aggregates on an SVM using SVM user credentials. To resolve this, you need to map the SVMs with the aggregates using the ONTAP REST API or CLI as described here.

REST API:

----
PATCH "/api/svm/svms/f16f0935-5281-11e8-b94d-005056b46485" '{"aggregates":{"name":["aggr1","aggr2","aggr3"]}}' 
----

ONTAP CLI:

== Create ONTAP user and role manually

Follow the instructions in this section to create the user and roles manually without using the JSON file.

. Access ONTAP System Manager using the cluster management IP address of the cluster.
. Log in as the cluster or SVM user.
. Select *Cluster* > *Settings* > *Users and Roles* pane.
. Create Roles:
.. Select *Add* under *Roles* table.
.. Enter the *Role name* and *Role Attributes* details. 
+
Add the *REST API Path* and the respective access from the drop down.
.. Add all the needed APIs and save the changes.
. Create Users:
.. Select *Add* under *Users* table.
.. In the *Add User* dialog box, select *System Manager*.
.. Enter the *Username*.
.. Select *Role* from the options created in the *Create Roles* step above.
.. Enter the applications to give access to and the authentication method. ONTAPI and HTTP are the required applications, and the authentication type is *Password*. 
.. Set the *Password for the User* and *Save* the user.
 

== List of minimum privileges required for non-admin global scoped cluster user

The minimum privileges required for non-admin global scoped cluster user created without using the users JSON file are listed in this section. 
If a cluster is added in local scope, it is recommended to use the JSON file to create the users, as ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere requires more than just the Read privileges for provisioning on ONTAP.
