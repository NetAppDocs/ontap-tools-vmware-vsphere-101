[.lead]
A vVols datastore exists as long as at least one FlexVol volume is available on the datastore. If you want to delete a vVols datastore in a HA cluster, you should first unmount the datastore from all hosts within the HA cluster, and then delete the residing _.vsphere-HA_ folder manually using the vCenter server user interface. 

*Steps*

Use the following API to delete vVols datastore.

​/virtualization​/api​/v1​/vcenters​/{vcguid}​/vvols​/datastores​/{moref}
